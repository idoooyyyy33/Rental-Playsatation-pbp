# TODO: Build Flutter App for Web

- [x] Enable Flutter web support using `flutter config --enable-web`
- [x] Run `flutter build web` to generate the `build/web` folder with JavaScript files
- [x] Verify the build output by checking contents of `build/web`
- [x] Optionally test locally with `flutter run -d web` (skipped as per user)
- [x] Prepare for GitHub upload (e.g., commit `build/web` contents if desired)

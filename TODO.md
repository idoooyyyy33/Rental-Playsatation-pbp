    - ✅ Fixed deprecated member use (replaced 'value' with 'initialValue' in DropdownButtonFormField)
    - ✅ Fixed unnecessary braces in string interpolation
    - ✅ Removed unnecessary dart:ui import
    - Status: ✅ Completed

## 🎉 **Project Summary**

**✅ State Management Successfully Separated!**

**Before:** 1 large `rental_state.dart` file handling everything (bookings, food, UI state)
**After:** 3 focused state files:
- `rental_state.dart` - Only rental/booking logic
- `food_state.dart` - Only food ordering logic
- `ui_state.dart` - Only UI state management

**✅ Food Menu UI Completely Redesigned!**

**New Modern Design Features:**
- 🎨 Beautiful gradient header with glassmorphism effects
- 📱 Modern card design with subtle shadows and gradients
- 🏷️ Preparation time badges on food items
- 🎯 Improved typography and spacing
- 💫 Enhanced visual hierarchy
- 🍔 Better food category icons and styling
- ✨ Smooth animations and transitions
- 🎪 Modern tab bar with pill-style indicators

**✅ UI Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ **"Tambah" text visibility**: Made text white for better contrast on purple buttons
- ✅ **Layout overflow**: Reduced header height from 160px to 140px and adjusted padding
- ✅ **No more yellow overflow warnings**: Layout now fits properly on screen

**✅ Code Quality Improvements:**
- ✅ Eliminated code duplication (shift_keeper files)
- ✅ Better error tracking and debugging
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- ✅ No syntax or linting errors
- ✅ Modern UI/UX design patterns
- ✅ Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes

**✅ All functionality preserved:**
- PS booking system ✅
- Food ordering system ✅
- Shift keeper management ✅

Your project is now much better organized, easier to maintain, and has a modern, professional UI with no layout issues! 🚀✨
